Mobile Team Testing Challenge
=============================

This application is a simple API client that allows a user to log in and displays their tracks and likes. Currently it does not contain any testing whatsoever.

The Task
--------
1. Fork this repository
2. Add suitable testing infrastructure
3. Write some appropriate test cases. There's no need to aim for high coverage; just write whatever you think is important and useful
4. Replace this README with a file explaining briefly the approach you took with this task, why you selected particularly testing frameworks and why you chose to write particular tests. Also, please discuss how you think your approach should form part of a normal development workflow and any other external considerations.


Repository Notes
----------------

We make heavy use of submodules. Please check out your fork as following to avoid build problems:

	git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/mobile-testing-challenge.git
	cd mobile-testing-challenge
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
	
Have fun! If you have any problems, please email your contact in HR.
